### 💼 About Me

🔹 I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer with 4 years of professional experience building scalable, high-performance applications using **Java** and **Spring Boot** on the backend and **Angular** on the frontend. I specialize in designing and implementing RESTful APIs and microservices that power modern web applications.                         
🔹 With a strong foundation in both backend and frontend technologies, I create seamless user experiences while ensuring robust and maintainable server-side logic. My expertise includes integrating message brokers, handling asynchronous event-driven architectures, and optimizing database interactions. Experienced in building event-driven, decoupled architectures by integrating Apache Camel for reliable data routing, and implementing Kafka and MQ for asynchronous messaging.                                    
🔹Experienced in Agile methodologies, I actively contribute to sprint planning, code reviews, and collaborative problem-solving to consistently deliver quality features ahead of schedule. I am passionate about clean code, automated testing (JUnit), and continuous improvement to maintain high standards of software quality.
